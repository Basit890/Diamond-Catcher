# Catch the Diamonds

Welcome to **Catch the Diamonds**, a lively Pygame-based game where you use a moving plate to catch colorful falling diamonds! As you rack up points, the diamonds fall faster, testing your reflexes and focus. Built with Python and Pygame, this project is my take on a classic arcade-style game, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share it!

## Features
- Catch vibrant diamonds (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta) with a sleek plate
- Increasing difficulty: diamonds speed up as your score grows
- Intuitive UI with restart, pause/play, and exit buttons
- Smooth, frame-independent movement with delta time
- Side score counter to track your progress

## How to Play
1. Install Python 3 and Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
